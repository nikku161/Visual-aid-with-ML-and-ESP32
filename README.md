# Visual-aid-with-ML-and-ESP32
The visual aid ( modern helping aid) helps to detect some general objects in 
the environment concerning visually impaired people and then identify them with their separation with 
voice transmission of the detected information. This also aims to save them from uneven 
surfaces . We integrated computer vision/opencv and distance sensors for object detection and display distance from the person . We have used servos for making the detection of distance in whole space in frame.
object nor the distance from it and that's what our prototype has aimed to achieve. 
Our prototype also aims in the future to guide visually impaired people through uneven surfaces like staircases, potholes, and uneven surfaces that haven't been built till now . 
We also aim to make blind people self-sufficient in travelling places and add more features to our prototype in the future. (gps and sign detection,dim light)
